# RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor
Using Verilog HDL

## Overview
This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor using Verilog HDL. The processor is designed to execute RISC-V instructions in a single clock cycle per instruction, making it a straightforward and educational example of processor design.

## Features
- **Single-Cycle Execution**: Each instruction is executed in one clock cycle.
- **RISC-V ISA**: Implements a subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
- **Verilog HDL**: Entire processor design is written in Verilog, a hardware description language.
